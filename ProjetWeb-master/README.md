# ProjetWeb


Here is our web project.

When launching the Main.java file, the code is working. It creates a console that enables to specify each of the parameters used in the algorithm. It works for the Renjine and the Weka libraries.

About the scikit library, we have created the java files necessary to use it in Java. But we weren't able to link it with the Java console as we did with the other libraries. Indeed, we struggled to find the right interpreter to read Python codes.

Moreover, we have created the HTML form asked and we already had MML code form. But we were unable to link those two pages with our programs. That is why we are forced to used a console and to specify the different values in it.

We are really sorry to return a project unfinished such as this one, but the four of us were new to Java, it was difficult for us to gather all the right knowledge to lead this project to an end. We have then chosen to use the return to show at least a code working from some libraries, even if it wasn't complete, and to give you some of our codes (for scikit for example) even if they were not performing completely.
